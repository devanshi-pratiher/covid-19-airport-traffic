# covid-19-airport-traffic

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected various factors in our life. One of the many factors that has been affected is the global flight traffic. Since COVID-19 is contracted from droplets of an infected personâ€™s cough or breath and could be contracted through surfaces that are touched by people who are infected, travelling is very unsafe during this time. Since the chances of contracting COVID-19 are increased because of exposure to various people in the airport, air travel places people at risk of contracting this disease. Thus, during the pandemic, the number of people who use the airport decreased. 


Goals and Objectives
Our objective for this project is to create a visualization that analyzes the trends in the airport traffic volume throughout the year (January-November). The goal is to help us understand how the global pandemic affected air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and better visualize them throughout the globe. Looking at outliers and find the overarching patterns throughout the world, it will help us understand how the global pandemic affected air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and better understand the trends throughout the globe. 
My goal is to help visually understand how the evolution of Covid-19 has had a direct impact on airlines and airport traffic throughout the globe. For example, if Covid rates in China are at an all time high, we can visualize the airport traffic rates as either increasing or decreasing across the globe.
